The "axe.min.js" file is a JavaScript library provided by the Axe accessibility testing tool. Axe is a popular open-source accessibility testing framework used to identify and resolve accessibility issues in web applications. The "axe.min.js" file contains the minified version of the Axe library, which you can include in your web projects to perform automated accessibility tests.

When integrated into a web page, this library can analyze the page's HTML structure, ARIA attributes, and other accessibility-related aspects to detect potential accessibility violations. It provides a comprehensive set of rules based on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to help developers ensure their websites are accessible to users with disabilities.

By including "axe.min.js" in your accessibility testing workflow, you can automate the process of identifying and fixing accessibility issues, making your web applications more inclusive and usable for all users.
